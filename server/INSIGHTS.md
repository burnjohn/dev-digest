# Insights — server

Server-side decisions and dead ends. Read before redesigning anything here; a
lot of what looks arbitrary was a deliberate trade-off.

Read at the start of a task, written at the end of one, by the
`engineering-insights` skill. Sections are fixed — add to the one that fits,
newest first. If it would be obvious to anyone reading the code, leave it out.

Formats — `Decisions` takes prose; every other section takes a dated bullet:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title>

**What:** the decision, in one sentence.
**Why:** the constraint that forced it.
**Rejected:** what we tried or considered, and how it failed.
```

```markdown
- **YYYY-MM-DD** — <the claim, specific enough to act on cold>.
  `src/path/to/file.ts:42`
```

Roughly 5 entries per section. Promote stable entries into `docs/` and delete
them here. Insights about `src/vendor/shared/` go in the **root** `INSIGHTS.md` —
a contract change reaches every package.

## Decisions

### 2026-07-31 — Schema-first validation at the route boundary

**What:** every route declares Zod `params`/`body`/response schemas from
`@devdigest/shared` via `fastify-type-provider-zod`; invalid input is rejected
with `422` before the handler runs.
**Why:** one definition has to drive both request validation and response
serialization, or the two drift.
**Rejected:** hand-rolled `Schema.parse(req.body)` inside each handler — it
validated input only, left responses unchecked, and duplicated the schema
reference in every route.

## Codebase Patterns

- **2026-08-04** — `agent_runs` counters (`findings_count`, `blockers`, and now
  `critical_count`/`warning_count`/`suggestion_count`) are denormalized onto the
  run row once, at run completion in `run-executor.ts`, and never recomputed —
  even after a finding is later accepted/dismissed. This is intentional: the
  timeline shows the deterministic CI-gate snapshot, not a live view. A new
  per-severity/per-status counter on a run belongs in this same
  compute-once-at-write-time path (new column + migration), not a read-time
  `JOIN`/`GROUP BY` over `findings` — the latter would silently diverge from
  `blockers`' semantics (gate-tripped at run time vs. currently-live findings).
  `server/src/modules/reviews/run-executor.ts:238` (blockers/counts computed),
  `server/src/modules/reviews/repository/run.repo.ts:40` (read path, no
  aggregation query).

- **2026-08-04** — `ReviewRepository` in `repository.ts` re-declares each repo
  function's params type inline instead of importing it from the
  `repository/*.repo.ts` module that owns it (e.g. `completeAgentRun`'s
  `values` shape is written out twice: `repository.ts:153` and
  `repository/run.repo.ts:148`). Adding a field to one and not the other
  type-errors immediately at the call site, but only because both call sites
  happen to be typechecked in the same `tsc` run — it is easy to touch only one
  copy and get a real but confusing error pointing at the *caller*, not the
  missing field.

## Tool & Library Notes

- **2026-08-08** — dependency-cruiser 17.4.3 matches forbidden-rule
  `to.path` against `dependency.resolved`, not the unresolved module specifier.
  Package rules therefore need resolved `node_modules/<package>` patterns,
  `preserveSymlinks: true` stabilizes pnpm paths, builtins appear without the
  `node:` prefix, and `@devdigest/shared` resolves under `src/vendor/shared/`.
  `server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`

- **2026-08-08** — dependency-cruiser's JSON reporter exits zero even when
  `summary.violations` contains error-severity findings. Semantic gate tests
  must parse and compare that array instead of treating process status as the
  violation signal. `server/test/architecture-gate.test.ts`

- **2026-08-08** — A server-only dependency-cruiser target must be anchored as
  `^src/`; a generic `(?:^|/)src/` also matches `../reviewer-core/src/` and
  creates false cross-package violations. `server/.dependency-cruiser.cjs`
