// A second real diff whose violations map onto DevDigest-SPECIFIC rule names
// (`reviewer-core-zero-io`, `reviewer-core-ground-findings-gate`) that a competent model will
// describe in prose but will not spontaneously name unless the agent forces a citation. This is
// the discriminating case for the strict-vs-lite A/B: both variants should FIND both problems,
// but only the strict variant (which keeps the "cite the exact documented rule per finding" hard
// rule) should reliably emit the identifier. The checkout diff's textbook violations don't
// discriminate — the model volunteers `inward-only-dependencies`/`di-discipline` either way.

${fx("reviewer-core-gate.diff")}`;

// A diff that violates NO documented rule (a pure local-variable rename inside a domain file, no
// new imports, no cross-layer edges). A grounded reviewer should report zero violations. This
// surfaces the COST of relaxing the citation rule: freed from "every finding must name a
// documented contract", the lite variant is more prone to fabricating a judgment/best-practice
// finding where the strict variant stays silent.

// Shared across the strict (architecture-reviewer) and relaxed (architecture-reviewer-lite)
// variants so the two agents are graded on the exact same task — the only thing that should
// move between the two runs is whether "cites the specific documented rule" keeps passing.
